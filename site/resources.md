When adding your link to a bullet, make sure to use the following format:

* [**title**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Unidata/pyaos-ams-2021/blob/master/notebooks/<rest-of-path>.html)<space><space>
  Add description here

Note the two empty spaces after the closing parenthesis (i.e. <space><space>).
This is critical, as lines that end with two empty space characters will be rendered as a <br> html element.
The end result is a tighter vertical spacing between the opening line of the bullet point (the link) and the notebook description.

  This notebook provides an overview on how to use the declarative syntax within MetPy to create satellite, surface, upper-air, and model data maps. MetPy's METAR parsing functionality is also utilized in this tutorial, along with data smoothing methods. Another useful resource for those interested in learning more about the declarative syntax is the [declarative tutorial on MetPy's website](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/tutorials/declarative_tutorial.html)
